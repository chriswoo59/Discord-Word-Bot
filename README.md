# Discord-Word-Bot
A bot that lets you play games of Wordle on Discord

This is a personal project I am working on for fun. No guarantees that I make a fully completed, professional bot.

# How it currently works
Default prefix is '~'. Change it with ~changeprefix or ~cp.
Start a daily word with ~daily or a random word with ~random. Daily words can only be started once. Random words can be restarted with new words as many times as you wish.
You will DM the bot your guesses, which the bot will respond with how correct you are to the actual word.
Once you guess the correct word or run out of tries, the bot will respond in your original channel or in the DMs if you started there.
